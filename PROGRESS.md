# Tau Autobuilder — Progress Log

## 2026-06-25 — auto/ltspice-parity — LTspice expression engine + .param/.func resolved through every solver (§5)

### What I did
- Built a complete LTspice/SPICE **expression evaluator** (`simulation/expr.ts`):
  tokenizer + precedence-climbing parser + evaluator. SI-suffixed literals
  (1k/2.2meg/10n/1mil, trailing unit ignored), `+ - * / % ^ **` (power
  right-assoc, `-2^2 = -4`), comparison/logical/ternary, built-in functions
  (trig, exp/ln/log10, sqrt, abs, sgn, min/max, floor/ceil/round, pow/pwr/pwrs,
  if, limit, table w/ interpolation, uramp/u/buf/inv), constants (pi, e), and
  user `.func` calls (args bound into a child scope, nested funcs resolve).
- Built **`.param`/`.func` scope resolution** (`simulation/paramScope.ts`):
  `buildParamScope` parses directive strings (multi-assignment lines, the rare
  name-value form), resolves inter-param references in any order via an
  iterative fixpoint, and throws on cycles/undefined refs. `substituteBraces`
  does LTspice-style `{…}` → literal substitution (incl. inside compound specs
  like `PULSE(0 {Vhi} …)`); `resolveComponentValues` maps a component list.
- **Threaded the scope through every solve path** — `runTransientAnalysis`,
  `runOperatingPoint`, `runAcSweep`, and `buildSpiceDeck` now accept an optional
  `params: ParamScope` and resolve brace values before extraction. No-param
  circuits and brace-free components pay nothing (fast path returns the same
  array reference).
- End-to-end proof (`paramIntegration.test.ts`): a `{Vsrc}/{Rtop}/{Rbot}`
  divider with `.param Vsrc=12 Rtop=1k` / `.param Rbot={Rtop*3}` solves to the
  hand-computed 9 V, and the native deck emits concrete numbers (no braces).

### Files touched
- src/simulation/expr.ts (new), src/simulation/expr.test.ts (new, 32 tests)
- src/simulation/paramScope.ts (new), src/simulation/paramScope.test.ts (new, 22 tests)
- src/simulation/paramIntegration.test.ts (new, 7 tests)
- src/simulation/{linearTransient,operatingPoint,acSweep}.ts (thread params)
- src/engine/spiceNetlist.ts (thread params)
- FEATURE_PARITY.md (§5: .param/.func/{expr}/built-ins → ✅; .step still ⬜)

### Tests
324 passing (was 263; +61 new). Typecheck clean. (Note: the full suite is
timing-sensitive — saw a transient 2-test flake once under load that did not
reproduce on three subsequent clean runs; native-ngspice spawn latency suspected,
not a logic regression.)

### FEATURE_PARITY items updated
- §5 `.param` ✅, `.func` ✅, `{expression}` ✅, built-in functions+constants ✅.
  `.step param` remains ⬜ (needs the sweep driver in §4).

### UX issues found
- None (no UI surface changed).

### Next step
Add `directives?: string[]` to `SchematicDocument` (+ `Doc`, `docOf`,
`copyDocument`, persistence) and have `App.tsx` call `buildParamScope(directives)`
and pass `params` to all run sites — this lights up the chain for imported
`.asc` files (FEATURE_PARITY §1 d). Wire `ascToSchematic`'s parsed `TEXT !`
directives into that field at the same time, then map `.tran`/`.ac`/`.op`
directives to the matching analysis runner.

## 2026-06-25 — auto/ltspice-parity — ascToSchematic() + pinOverride + electrical net labels

### What I did
- Implemented `ascToSchematic()` (FEATURE_PARITY §1 task a) and pin-accurate
  connectivity via `pinOverride` (task b) — the documented next step for the key
  goal (open the user's real `.asc` files).
- Made net labels **electrical** (they were cosmetic): `extractCircuit` now takes
  an optional `netLabels` arg, merges same-named FLAGs into one net, treats
  `0`/`GND` as ground, and names the net after its label so `V(vcc)` resolves.
  Threaded `netLabels` through native ngspice + all three TS solvers + App.tsx.
- Added `PinOverride` (absolute world pin positions) to `SchematicComponent`;
  `getComponentPins` honors it (falls back to kind+rotation geometry otherwise).
- `ascToSchematic` maps symbols → components with `pinOverride = anchor +
  transformLtPoint(pin)`, wires 1:1, FLAGs → ground symbols / net labels, and
  `TEXT` → directives / comments. 3-terminal MOS bulk tied to source. Unmappable
  vendor symbols skipped with a warning; mapped-but-unbanked symbols (opamps)
  placed and honestly flagged.

### Files touched
- src/schematic/types.ts (PinOverride + field)
- src/schematic/pins.ts (honor pinOverride)
- src/schematic/netlist.ts (electrical net labels, net naming)
- src/schematic/netlist.test.ts (+7 tests), src/schematic/pins.test.ts (new, 4 tests)
- src/io/ascImport.ts (ascToSchematic + helpers), src/io/ascImport.test.ts (+6 tests)
- src/engine/spiceNetlist.ts, src/engine/nativeSpice.ts (thread netLabels)
- src/simulation/{linearTransient,acSweep,operatingPoint}.ts (thread netLabels)
- src/App.tsx (pass netLabels to run sites + deps)
- FEATURE_PARITY.md (§1 a/b ✅, net-labels-electrical note)

### Tests
263 passing (was 246; +17 new). Typecheck clean. Validated against the real
`~/Downloads/LTspice_export/deadtime.asc` and `class-d_starter.asc` via throwaway
tests (since removed): both import without throwing, ground resolves, vcc/vee/etc
collapse to single nets, directives parse.

### FEATURE_PARITY items updated
- §1 import `.asc`: (a) ascToSchematic ✅, (b) pinOverride connectivity ✅,
  net-labels-electrical ✅ (line remains 🟡 overall — (c) Open dialog and
  (d) directive→analysis mapping still pending).
- §2 net labels: annotated as now electrical.

### UX issues found
- None this run (no UI surface changed). Note: imported components still render
  at Tau's built-in geometry (pins are correct via override, but the drawn symbol
  won't visually match LTspice spacing) — tracked as a §1 follow-up.

### Next step
Wire `ascToSchematic` into an Open dialog / file picker so a user can actually
load a `.asc` into the store (FEATURE_PARITY §1 task c), then map parsed
`TEXT !` directives (`.tran`/`.ac`/`.param`/`.meas`) to runnable analyses (task d).
